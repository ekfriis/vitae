I started my undergraduate career as an electrical engineer. As far as I knew, people who enjoyed the sciences majored in engineering, went to work at a fancy company and then made lots of money.  However, during the last lecture of Intro to Quantum Physics, the final physics course required of engineers, I realized how much I had enjoyed physics and how sad I was to be finished with it.  Professor Vivek Sharma, a collider physicist, projected a picture of the Collider Detector at Fermilab, a gigantic detector bristling with electronics, and said "All of you engineers, why don't you switch to physics?  We have plenty of wires and computers too." 

I filed the papers to change my major later that day.  

I graduated from UC San Diego in 2005 with a B.S. in physics, and started my graduate physics career at UC Davis, specializing in experimental particle physics under the guidance of Professor John Conway.  I work on a particle physics experiment called the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) in Geneva, Switzerland, which recently began to produce its first data.  After my first two years of coursework at Davis, I advanced to candidacy and had the good fortune to be able to spend ten months living in Geneva and working at the lab.  

One of the most rewarding aspects of my field is the diversity of people in it.  The CMS collaboration has 3600 members from 180 countries.  While it can be challenging to work with such a diverse group of people, the intellectual power of this ensemble of thinking styles all focused on the same problem produces amazing results.

Due to a challenging funding climate, I returned to Davis in 2008 to support my research as a TA.  I still work on the CMS experiment, and collaborate with the same people, though over videoconferenceâ€”and with a nine-hour time difference. Fortunately, I can disable the camera so people won't see that I'm attending the 5 a.m. meeting in my pajamas. 

I enjoy my time in Davis. I particularly love TAing and developing curriculum for the electronics class for physics majors.  However, as I enter the final phase of my graduate career, I will need to spend extended time at the CMS lab in Geneva to work directly with my colleagues.  As the first data from the CMS experiment comes in, it is critical that I be at the lab to maximize my scientific impact, and represent myself, UC Davis, and the United States in this new era of physics.
