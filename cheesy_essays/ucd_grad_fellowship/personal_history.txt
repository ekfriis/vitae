I started my undergraduate career as an electrical engineer. As far as I knew, people that enjoyed the sciences majored in engineering, went to work at a fancy company and then made lots of money.  However, in the final lecture in Intro to Quantum Physics, the final physics course required of engineers, I realized how much I had enjoyed physics and how sad I was to be finished with it.  In a moment of divine providence, Prof. Vivek Sharma, a collider physicist, projected a picture of the Collider Detector at Fermilab, a gigantic detector bristling with electronics, and said "All of you engineers, why don't you switch to physics?  We have plenty of wires and computers too." I love big machines.  I filed the papers to change my major later that day.  

I graduated from UC San Diego in 2005 with a B.S. in physics, and started my graduate physics career at UC Davis, specializing in experimental particle physics under the guidance of Prof. John Conway.  I work on a particle physics experiment called the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) in Geneva, Switzerland, that is just now producing its first data.  After my first two years of coursework at Davis, I advanced to candidacy and had the good fortune to be able to spend ten months living in Geneva and working at the lab.  

One of the most rewarding aspects of my field is the diversity of people in it.  The CMS collaboration has 3600 members, from 180 countries.  While it can be challenging to work with such a diverse group of people, the intellectual potential of a diverse ensemble of thinking styles all focused on the same problem produces amazing results.

Due to a challenging funding situation, I returned to Davis in 2008 to support my research as a TA.  I still work on the CMS experiment, and collaborate with the same people, though over videoconference with a nine hour time difference.  It's fortunate that I can turn off the camera so people can't see that I'm attending the 5am meeting in my pajamas. 

I enjoy my time here in Davis, and I love TAing and developing curriculum for the electronics class for physics majors.  However, as I enter the final phase of my graduate career, I will need to spend some extended time traveling to the lab to work directly with my colleagues.  As the first data from the CMS experiment comes in, it is critical that I be at the lab to maximize my scientific impact, and represent myself, UC Davis, and the United States in this new era of physics.
