Please give details of the work you are interested in doing at CERN*

I am interested in continuing my research searching for the Higgs boson in channels with tau leptons.  I have developed new techniques using taus that greatly improved the sensitivity of the recently completed CMS MSSM Higgs search.  My goal is to apply these techniques to other Higgs searches using future LHC data. Additionally, I would continue my contributions to the silicon tracker calibrations and luminous region monitoring, and explore opportunities to contribute to detector development.

explaining what they hope to achieve at CERN and their interest in this
programme.

My search for the Higgs using tau leptons using the (relatively modest) 2010 LHC data has been a resounding success: as a result of hard work and innovative techniques, the analysis set the world's best limits on the MSSM.  The results obtained using only 36pb^-1 are better than a 2009 prediction that assumed three times the data and a higher collision energy.  This progress will accelerate with the upcoming flood of LHC data, and I am very excited to find out what nature has in store for us.  The CERN fellowship is the ideal way for me to continue this research.  I am self-motivated, and the ability to choose the direction of my research provided by a CERN fellowship will allow me to pursue creative research ideas and maximize my contributions to physics.  Over the course of my graduate career I have built strong networks with my colleagues at CERN and have expert-level knowledge of the resources that CERN provides.  My professional goal for the coming years is to set the world's best limits on (or discover!) the Higgs boson using tau leptons, and be involved in a silicon tracker project.
