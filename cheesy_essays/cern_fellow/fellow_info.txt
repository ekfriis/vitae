Expected defense/submission date: June 15, 2011
Thesis: Search for Higgs bosons decaying to $\tau$ leptons at $\sqrt s=7$ TeV
Supervisor: John Conway

A search was performed for Mininimal Super Symmetric Model (MSSM) Higgs bosons decaying to tau leptons in the 2010 CMS dataset.  New exclusion limits were set on the MSSM.  The thesis also describes the development of a novel new tau identificaiton and mass reconstruction algorithms, which dramatically improved the sensitivity of the search.
