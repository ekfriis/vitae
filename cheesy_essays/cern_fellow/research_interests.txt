The bulk of my previous research has concerned development of new experimental
techniques using tau leptons and their application in searches for the MSSM
Higgs boson. The use of these techniques has dramatically enhanced the
sensitivity of the CMS MSSM Higgs analysis.  In the future, I will extend the
number of channels in the MSSM analysis and apply these techniques to other
Higgs searches using taus.  These analyses will allow the LHC to set the world's
best limits on (or discover) the Higgs boson with the 2011 and 2012 data.  There
are also a number of potential improvements to the new tau techniques that I
would like to implement.  The introduction of these techniques improved the
sensitivity of the current Higgs search by 20%; further improvement in these
methods would translate directly to improved search significance in current and
future datasets.  Finally, I plan to become involved in developing future
detectors, particularly new silicon tracking systems.
