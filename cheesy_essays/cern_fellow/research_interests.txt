The bulk of my previous research has been the development of new experimental techniques using tau leptons and their application in searches for the MSSM Higgs boson.  The use of these techniques dramatically enhanced the sensitivity of the CMS MSSM Higgs analysis.  In the future, I plan to apply these techniques in other Higgs searches (like the Standard Model) using tau leptons with the goal of setting new limits with the 2011 and 2012 LHC data.  Furthermore, there are a number of potential improvements to these methods that I am interested in implementing.  An improvement in either of these methods translates directly to increased search significance in current and future CMS datasets.
Finally, in my post-graduate career I would like to become involved in developing future detectors, particularly silicon tracking systems.  I have experience in electronics and embedded systems development, and would like to develop these skills and contribute to a hardware design project.
